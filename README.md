# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**! This Java project is an interactive and fun game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range and limited attempts.

## How It Works
- The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**.
- The player starts with **6 chances** to guess the number.
- After each incorrect guess, hints are provided:

  - *"Go below"* if the guess is too high.
- The game ends when the player guesses the correct number or runs out of chances.
